<h2> Why do you want this career? </h2>

<p> I have an NQF level 4 in Computer Application Technology (CAT) and boy was it an adventure! It is as if I learned a completely different language, that not many understand. The more I am exposed to it, the more I would like to explore and learn about HTML, be exposed to JavaScript, and accomplish in Python. Is this career something I want? YES! And do I have a company that specializes in developing that skill? YES! My mother once said “Opportunity + preparation = success”. I would like to succeed in this career, as a web developer. </p>

  <h2>What inspired this decision? </h2>
  <p>
    On a Sunday afternoon, my father and I made a stop at a family gathering. My cousin Westley applied for Data Analyst or Science through Umuzi, which sparked an interest. With my basic knowledge of a Web-Developing and a company willing to give me a place, it looks like an open door for me!

  <h2>Why did you apply for the specific course you applied for?</h2>
  <P>
 Web-Development is the career I see myself in and opening doors such as the Umuzi learnership will get me there and help me to achieve my long-term goal as well as have relevance or needed in the field that I will be working in. My exposure to HTML in High School really sparked an interest and played a huge role in my decision-making to further improve my skill.
